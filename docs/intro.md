# Overview

The <a href="www.nice-train.com">Nice Train Website</a> is the website for Nice Train, our grappling club!

The primary goal of the site is to be a catalog of youtube resources that we use to develop drilling programs. There is an art gallery that has been tacked on, but needs to be developed more fully. An online store-front is also in the works.

## Document Structure

My plan is to divide this document into three main sections:

<ul>
    <li>Feature Design</li>
    <li>Graphic Design</li>
    <li>Code Structure</li>
</ul>

We'll see if this dividing of concerns will survive contact with actual documentation writing.

<!-- ## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes. -->
